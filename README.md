# random_shapes
Making random shapes in R

the script includes a bunch of functions that start with "rnd_" and make various random combinations of shapes
at the moment anything past rnd_circles_on_splines is super experimental

## REQUIRED PACKAGES:

tibble, dplyr, ggplot2, bezier, ggforce
to make things easier just import tidyverse first

## FUNCTIONS NEEDED INSIDE FUNCTIONS:

rnd_colors, theta_unif, theta_rnorm

all three can be found at the top of the script
